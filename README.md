# ODDITY

## Introduction
This is the base of the project. Web interface (client) + API (server)

- As a database we use MongoDB, because it's very dynamic and you can easily switch format of your data stored which is helpfull in fast and changing development
- We have a client for managing everything for the API this is a react app.
- We have a server for inter-domain communications this is an API made with Fasitfy it talks to the MongoDB through Mongoose
